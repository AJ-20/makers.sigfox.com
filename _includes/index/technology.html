    <h2>Frequencies</h2>
    <p>The SIGFOX network is relying on Ultra-Narrow Band(UNB) modulation, and operating in unlicensed sub-GHz frequency bands. <br />
    This protocol offer a great resistance to jamming & standard interferers, as well as a great capacity per receiving base stations
    SIGFOX complies with local regulations, adjusting central frequency, power output and duty cycles.

    <h2>Sending a message</h2>
  <p>There is no signaling, nor negotiation between a device and a receiving station. <br />
  The device decices when to send its message, picking up a pseudo-random frequency.<br />
  It's up to the network to detect the incoming messages, as well as validating & deduplicating them.<br />
  The message is then available in the Sigfox cloud, and forwarded to any 3rd party cloud platform chosen by the user.<
    </p>
    <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
  Every message is signed, with informations proper to the device (incl. a unique private key) and to the message itself. <br />
  This prevent spoofing, alteration or replay of genuine messages. <br />
  Encryption & scrambling of the data are supported, with the choice of the more appropriate solution up to the consumer.
