<h1>SIGFOX and Omantel Join Forces to Rollout Dedicated Internet of Things Network in Sultanate of Oman</h1>

<p><i>Offering Full Spectrum of Telecommunication Solutions in Oman, Omantel is the 

First SIGFOX Network Operator in the Middle East</i></p>

<p>LABEGE, France, and MUSCAT, Oman – April 12, 2016 – SIGFOX, the world’s leading 

provider of a dedicated communications service for the Internet of Things (IoT), and 

Omantel, the Sultanate of Oman’s leading provider of integrated telecommunication 

services, today announced plans to deploy SIGFOX’s IoT network in the Sultanate.</p>

<p>As a SIGFOX Network Operator, Omantel will work closely with SIGFOX’s global IoT

ecosystem, including manufacturers of components and objects, to offer a wide variety of 

connected solutions for smart applications, energy efficiency, agriculture, security and 

other uses. The companies expect to offer network coverage to 85 percent of Oman’s 

population within 18 months.</p>

<p>Omantel, the Sultanate’s leading provider of integrated telecommunication services, is

implementing the Omantel 3.0 transformation strategy, which includes adopting proven 

new technologies and expanding services, in line with the company’s plans to lead 

digitization in the Sultanate.</p>

<p>“As innovators and early adopters of proven new technologies, it is vital that Omantel

partners with like-minded companies to deliver the potential of the Omantel 3.0

transformation strategy,” said Samy Ahmed Al Ghassany, chief operating officer at 

Omantel. “SIGFOX offers a pioneering IoT solution that will complement our

comprehensive telecommunication services. This agreement strongly supports our 

commitment to innovate by enhancing infrastructure and using new technologies that 

increase our network coverage and capabilities.”</p>

<p>“This is an exciting partnership for SIGFOX since Omantel is a highly innovative telecom

provider that is committed to offering its business and residential customers a broad suite 

of services, including SIGFOX global IoT connectivity,” said Thierry Siminger, president of 

SIGFOX Middle East and Africa (MEA). “This deployment in the Sultanate of Oman also is 

a major milestone in SIGFOX’s expansion in the MEA region”.</p> 

<p>Earlier this month, SIGFOX announced the rollout of its network in New Zealand and

Australia, which also added another continent to the company’s global coverage map. This 

new deployment in Oman marks the addition of the 17

SIGFOX network rollout in the Middle East, with a huge potential market.</p>
