</p><p>Many of you have been very excited to learn about the
recent partnership between SIGFOX and Samsung Electronics and
the&nbsp;official&nbsp;launch of the&nbsp;ARTIK platform, publicly announced in
Paris in June.</p><p>ARTIK&nbsp;will integrate SIGFOX’s IoT protocol and&nbsp;will make developing smart devices for the IoT faster and easier.&nbsp;The integration is designed to extend the cost-effective and energy-efficient benefits of the SIGFOX network to Samsung ARTIK developers who are designing IoT products and services around the world.&nbsp;</p><p>ARTIK itself includes three circuit boards, software support, developer tools, and embedded encryption for security, providing a complete&nbsp;hardware and software solution designed specifically for companies working on connected objects.&nbsp; This will certainly lead to faster and simpler development of new enterprise, industrial and consumer applications for the IoT. You can find out more on the dedicated site:&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.artik.io/">www.artik.io</a>.</p><p>This type of partnership makes complete sense in the context of a completely open and wide-ranging SIGFOX eco-system, where partners collaborate and build new solutions that were previously not possible or extremely difficult to achieve alone.</p><p>A perfect illustration of harnessing the power and potential of such partnerships is seen through the new solution from Weenat (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.weenat.com/">www.weenat.com</a>). They are the makers of a solution that is being referred to as a&nbsp;technologically connected agricultural revolution.</p><p>Weenat point out that&nbsp;that&nbsp;Agriculture accounts for 70% of the world’s water consumption, yet the world is currently facing one of the biggest droughts of all time. Smart water use is therefore critical for today’s farmers and an issue that demands immediate attention.</p><p>Weenat’s mission is to revolutionize agronomics by providing farmers with affordable, easy solutions that help them to optimize time and make informed decisions about irrigation and crop management.</p><p>Their solution, known as “Weenats”, are completely wireless, connected sensors that measure and transmit soil and air data directly to a farmer’s smartphone or computer. Using the SIGFOX network, these sensors can be easily placed directly in the fields, are ready to use and dispatch&nbsp;data wirelessly to the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://weenat.com/">Weenat.com</a>&nbsp;application, along with the benefit of having a long battery life.</p><p>In the future, with the Samsung ARTIK production-ready platform, Weenat expects faster development of new types of measures, improved battery life and smaller form factors, making it even easier for farmers to access a maximum of information with minimal effort.</p><p>At SIGFOX, we fully appreciate&nbsp;Weenat’s mission and vision, as they continue to help farmers all over the world to implement intelligent water practices that save water, time and result in increased yields.&nbsp;</p><p>It is also a SIGFOX startups to gain more exposure and take their solutions to an international level.</p><p>Weenat’s solution is also a prime example of how the SIGFOX network can help startups to gain more exposure and scale their solutions to an international level. This is precisely the type of use that SIGFOX has been developed for: autonomous sensors, placed directly in the field to perform a specific function, with minimal intrusion or impact on the environment and yet capable of delivering powerful, actionable data to end-users and customers wherever they might be.</p><p>Weenat’s solution was&nbsp;first revealed at the IoT World in San Francisco in mid-May and then again in Paris for the official announcement of Samsung’s ARTIK platform and partnership with SIGFOX.
