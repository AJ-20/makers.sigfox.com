<h1>OVH & SIGFOX to Demonstrate Integration of Powerful Data-analysis Platform with SIGFOX IoT Network at CES 2016</h1>

<div class="illustration text-center"><img src="/img/news/logo-ovh-avec-150DPI.png"></div><p>Roubaix, France, and Labège, France – Jan. 6, 2016 – OVH, the
world’s leading “Digital as a Service” company, and SIGFOX, the world leader in
Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity, today announced the integration of OVH’s
PaaS TimeSeries service with SIGFOX’s Cloud, making it much simpler for
companies to implement and manage their IoT solutions. </p><p>The
two companies recently demonstrated more than 7,000 simple and cost-effective
connected sensors sending data through the SIGFOX IoT communications service to
the OVH PaaS TimeSeries service. </p><p>IoT PaaS TimeSeries is a platform
dedicated to collecting, processing, monitoring and
analyzing data from sensors in connected devices. Through
machine-learning algorithms, it can identify patterns and trigger actions based
on the data received. OVH also is working with many manufacturers to offer a plug-and-play
service to companies.</p><p>With 50 billion devices expected to be connected by 2020, the high potential of the IoT market implies a demand for storage and processing of a very large amount of data, which provides an appropriate scope to OVH and its 220,000 servers in 17 data centers. The company's global presence takes on a new dimension since its announcement, last September, of plans to open 12 new data centers by 2018.<br></p><p>“Facing this unprecedented digital revolution, SIGFOX and OVH’s complementarity offers new perspectives, enabling both companies to apprehend the entire value chain of the IoT,” said Laurent Allard, CEO of OVH. “By providing a turn-key solution for storing and managing data, as well as hosting business applications, OVH makes it much simpler, quicker and more cost effective to get up and running with Internet of Things applications.”<br>&nbsp;<br>SIGFOX’s
wireless device-to-cloud communications service is a subscription-based offer that
allows companies to integrate single devices or entire systems with the cloud,
without having to deal with the complexities of networking. This makes it much
simpler and more cost effective to collect data from physical objects.<br></p><p></p><p>The
SIGFOX ReadyTM&nbsp;certification program assures that devices are
compatible with the SIGFOX network and can be connected to the IoT easily by
any customer, anywhere the SIGFOX service is available. The network already is
operating or being deployed in 12 countries, covering more than 1 million
square kilometers.</p><p>A
company wishing to deploy an IoT solution can now choose from the many SIGFOX
ReadyTM certified devices, or build its own, and use OVH PaaS TimeSeries
APIs to retrieve the data for display in an app. Companies no longer need to
build and manage the databases and can thus focus on the business logic of
their solution.</p>“The
integration of OVH PaaS TimesSeries in SIGFOX’s Cloud is a key step in the
evolution of the IoT that will give customers continuous and unprecedented
insights into the status of their infrastructure and other assets, enabling
them to increase efficiency and lower costs,” said Stuart Lodge, SIGFOX executive
vice president global sales and partners. “With participation of leading
players such as OVH in the SIGFOX ecosystem, we are the only IoT connectivity
provider that allows customers to systematically use the wealth of data their
connected devices are sending.”<br><br>Companies such as&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.weenat.com/">Weenat</a>, with its live data-farming sensors, and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.connit.fr/en">Connit</a>, with its IoT solutions to optimize energy use and industrial maintenance, already are using the combined services.<br><br>SIGFOX and OVH plan to expand their collaboration through other initiatives aimed at further simplifying and accelerating time-to-market for Internet of Things solutions. These initiatives will be announced in 2016.<br><p><span><b>The two companies will be in Eureka Park at CES 2016,
