						<p>LUXEMBOURG CITY and ETTELBRUCK, Luxembourg, and LABEGE, France – July 27, 2015 – Continuing the rapid expansion of SIGFOX’s wireless Internet of Things network in Europe, SIGFOX and two partners, POST Luxembourg and RMS.lu, today announced the deployment of the network in Luxembourg.</p><p>POST Luxembourg&nbsp;is&nbsp;Luxembourg’s national telecommunications services operator and ICT service provider.</p><p>Founded in 1992 and based in Ettelbrück, Luxembourg,&nbsp;RMS.lu&nbsp;specializes in the development, installation and support of automatic-identification and mobility solutions for utilities, industry and commerce.</p><p>SIGFOX’s Ultra Narrow Band (UNB) technology complements existing high-bandwidth cellular systems, which are designed for the data-intensive needs of smartphones and other mobile electronics. It installs on standard cell towers or buildings and provides economical, energy-efficient, two-way transmission of small quantities of data over long distances, thus lowering barriers to wide implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) and machine-to-machine (M2M) solutions, and greatly extending the battery and service life of connected devices.</p><p>The SIGFOX global network, which is dedicated to the IoT, has already been deployed in Luxembourg City and&nbsp;Ettelbrück by&nbsp;POST Luxembourg and RMS.lu. It offers connectivity to 30 percent of the population of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and will provide nationwide coverage&nbsp;by year-end.&nbsp;Immediate uses for the subscription-based services for&nbsp;government agencies, companies and other users include smart-city applications for water metering, parking management, asset tracking and air-quality management, as well as applications for improving health care, insurance coverage and logistics.</p><p>“In addition to providing these essential IoT services, POST Luxembourg and RMS.lu will work with Luxembourg’s&nbsp;developers and businesses to grow the IoT ecosystem and create all kinds of new devices and applications,” said Jean-Marie Spaus, director of POST Telecom S.A.&nbsp;“The SIGFOX network strongly complements our existing wireless broadband offer and allows us to provide efficient, low-cost connectivity for objects that are designed to send small messages on an intermittent, as-needed basis.”</p><p>”With the SIGFOX network deployment, we will provide the infrastructure to help make Luxembourg’s economy more efficient and more competitive,” said Carlo Posing, director of RMS.lu.</p><p>Luxembourg is the fourth European country this year where SIGFOX network operators have announced plans to roll out the network, following Portugal, Belgium and Denmark. The network is operating in France, Spain, the U.K. and the Netherlands, as well as several major cities around the world. The company expects to make additional announcements of partnerships in Europe, Asia, the U.S. and South America this year.</p><div><p>“This network deployment in Luxembourg clearly illustrates the advantages that SIGFOX brings toentrepreneurial companies like RMS.luand toexisting broadband cellular providers, which is great recognition from one of the most advanced countries in the IoT space,” said Rodolphe Baronnet-Frugès, SIGFOX executive vice president of networks and operators. “POST Luxembourg has the existing nationwide infrastructure to speed deployment of a dedicated-IoT network that will strategically complement its high- bandwidth services with a very reliable, low-cost and low-power option that is unique because it can scale to millions of connected objects. RMS.lu recognizes the large business potential that the SIGFOX network offers users of its products and solutions for utilities, industry and commerce.”</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>About SIGFOX</b></p><b></b><p>SIGFOX is the only provider of dedicated cellular connectivity for Internet of Things and Machine-to-Machine communications.
