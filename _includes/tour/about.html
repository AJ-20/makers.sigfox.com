            As the first network dedicated to the IoT, SIGFOX leads to millions of applications that can change the world, from agriculture to smart metering & alert.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get people on board, the SIGFOX team is organizing workshops all around Europe. The SIGFOX team will present the network and its underlying technology, and run some demos and hands-on sessions using prototyping boards.
          </p>
          <p>
            The workshops will also enable you to start your project with SIGFOX: ready-to-use kits will be offered to attendees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those bootcamps are specifically made for makers, IoT startups, developers, and tech lovers. Come join us !
