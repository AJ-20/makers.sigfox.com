<h1>SIGFOX Adds Denmark to its Global Internet of Things Network</h1>

<div class="illustration text-center"><img src="/img/news/denmark.jpg"></div><p>LABEGE, France, and COPENHAGEN, Denmark – June 9, 2015 – SIGFOX, the global leader in cost-effective, energy-efficient Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity, and IoT Denmark A/S today announced plans to roll out the SIGFOX network in the Scandinavian country.<br></p><p>As a SIGFOX Network Operator, IoT Denmark will manage deployment of the network, work with Danish developers and businesses to grow the Danish IoT ecosystem and provide connectivity subscriptions to customers. Network deployment, which will cover some areas of the country by this summer, is expected to be completed by May 2016.</p><p>Unlike systems that are still in the development stage, SIGFOX’s Ultra Narrow Band (UNB) technology for connecting devices is providing scalable, long-range, two-way connectivity and very high capacity in more than a dozen countries and major cities.</p><p>Through the SIGFOX ReadyTM program, the company ensures that compatible devices have optimal radio performance and are promoted in the global SIGFOX ReadyTM solution catalogue. Moreover, the company partners with Texas Instruments, Atmel, Silicon Labs, Telit, AXSEM, ATIM and other chipmakers to give IoT users a wide choice of transceivers, systems-on-chips (SoCs) and modules for connecting their devices with its network. No other system offers this truly open approach.</p><p>Daniel Bachman, IoT Denmark’s CEO and founding partner, said the partnership with SIGFOX is designed to spur Danish entrepreneurs, engineers and others to create new IoT applications and projects that are easily justified by SIGFOX’s extremely cost- effective connectivity.</p><p><i>“Demand for SIGFOX’s low-cost, energy-efficient connectivity and its unmatched data capacity and reliability is very strong in Denmark, and we are in discussions with several future partners who are eager to begin using the network,” Bachman said. “We compared a variety of IoT network solutions, and determined that SIGFOX is the only one that is truly open to device manufacturers, and that can reliably handle the very large number of devices that will be connected across Denmark.”</i></p><p>SIGFOX, which recently raised $115 million in financing from U.S., European and Asian investors, is collaborating with partners in Spain, Portugal, France and the Netherlands, as well as many international cities, including San Francisco, Mumbai, Santiago, Chile; Medellin, Columbia; Munich, Milan, Warsaw, Poland; Dublin and 10 U.K. cities.</p><p><i>“IoT Denmark understands the demand in both the public and private sectors for SIGFOX’s superior connectivity and is committed to rapidly rolling out the network across the country,” said Rodolphe Baronnet-Frugès, SIGFOX executive vice president of networks and business development. “This once again highlights our network’s multiple advantages for partners and users compared to proposed alternatives. We expect to announce similar agreements in other Scandinavian countries, along with news of our expansion in the U.S., this summer.”</i></p><div><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>About SIGFOX</b></p><b></b><p>SIGFOX is the only provider of dedicated cellular connectivity for Internet of Things and Machine-to-Machine communications.
