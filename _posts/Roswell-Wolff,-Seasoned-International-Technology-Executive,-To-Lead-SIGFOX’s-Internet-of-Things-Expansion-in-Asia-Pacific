LABEGE, France – March 30, 2016 – SIGFOX, the world’s leading provider of global communications service for the Internet of Things (IoT), today announced that Roswell Wolff has joined the company as president of SIGFOX-APAC. Based in the company’s regional headquarters in Singapore, Wolff will lead the company’s Asia-Pacific expansion and the deployment of the SIGFOX global network across the whole Asia Pacific region within the next three years.
</p>
  <p>“From its launch, SIGFOX has planned to build a dedicated Internet of Things network that covers the world with seamless, low-cost and energy-efficient connectivity,” said Xavier Drilhon, SIGFOX deputy chief executive officer. “Asia Pacific is a major milestone on that path, and Roswell Wolff brings the experience, commitment and understanding of that market to rapidly bring the SIGFOX network benefits to operators, suppliers and users in the region.”</p>
<p>
Wolff is a seasoned international executive with more than 25 years of experience in the

digital, communications and M2M, software and systems-integration markets. He has

driven growth and profitability, as well as led strategy creation and implementation and

<p>“IDC has identified Asia Pacific as the ‘frontline’ for the Internet of Things, and SIGFOX’s

dedicated IoT network, with rapid rollout and international connectivity, will accelerate use 

of the IoT in that region,” Wolff said. “Billions of security, asset tracking, smart-city and 

utility-service devices will require regional connections and links to a global network, and

SIGFOX is the only company delivering this critical connectivity and IoT-solutions 

capability on a worldwide basis.”</p>
