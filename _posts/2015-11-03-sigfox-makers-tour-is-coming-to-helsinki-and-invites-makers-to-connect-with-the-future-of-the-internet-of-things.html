<div class="illustration text-center"><img src="/img/news/helsinki_venture.png"></div><p><b>Helsinki,
Finland – Labège, France</b><span> – <b>02.11.2015</b>
– SIGFOX, the global leader in cost-effective, energy-efficient Internet of
Things (IoT) connectivity, has recently kicked off a European road trip with
its SIGFOX Makers Tour. The tour is a series of workshops all around Europe, to
support communities of developers and makers to use SIGFOX’s&nbsp;technology
and network to create new use cases. It will stop in Helsinki on November 10,
in collaboration with Helsinki Ventures.</span></p>

<p>With the SIGFOX Makers Tour, SIGFOX aims to accelerate the
emergence of new connected objects, services and IoT applications wherever the
SIGFOX global network is available. In each city where it stops, local
partnerships with fablabs, hacker spaces, or startup accelerators are designed
to create long-lasting collaborations.</p>

<p>Helsinki Ventures, a boutique accelerator and early-stage
investor focused on northeastern Europe and founder of the Internet of Things
(IoT) Acceleration Program, will contribute to the success of the event thanks
to its vast community of makers, developers and startups.</p>

<p><span>“<i>By&nbsp;significantly lowering the cost and the energy consumption of
the connected objects, SIGFOX paves the way for multiple new applications that
can quickly and easily emerge</i>,”&nbsp;said Cédric
Giorgi,&nbsp;SIGFOX’s&nbsp;head of startup relations. “<i>The&nbsp;goal of the SIGFOX Makers Tour is to get to know all those who
will build the future of the Internet of Things, whether they work in a fablab
or in a large corporation, and encourage them to create and test
their&nbsp;applications</i>.”</span></p>

<p>Illustrating this, Bttn, a Helsinki Ventures portfolio
company and the simplest Internet-user interface in the world, has recently
chosen SIGFOX’s simple, cost-effective and energy-efficient connectivity to
dramatically expand the reach of its universal push- buttons.</p>

<p><span>Helsinki has a central position in the European tech
ecosystem. On November 11-12, it is hosting <i>Slush</i>,
the international event for startups and tech talents.&nbsp;By organizing the
SIGFOX Makers Tour workshop the day before Slush, SIGFOX takes the opportunity to
meet with local and international makers in the city for the event. Giorgi will
speak at the event.</span></p>

<p><b>A
half-day workshop on development kits</b></p>

<p>The
SIGFOX Makers Tour in Helsinki will include a half-day workshop featuring a
presentation on&nbsp;SIGFOX’s&nbsp;connectivity solution and the opportunity
for participants to use the company’s technology with a development kit. Each
participant will be allowed to keep the kit and will receive a one-year
subscription to the SIGFOX network, allowing him or her to develop and test
their ideas for future IoT applications.</p>

<p>SIGFOX
expects around 20 participants, whose admission to the event is free. They will
be chosen to ensure a homogeneous group of technical profiles. </p>
