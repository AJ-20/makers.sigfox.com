VT Networks will also work with SIGFOX to accelerate the development of IoT applications in Ireland and will connect over 1 million devices by 2017.</p><p>“Irish businesses have reacted quickly to adopt new, beneficial technology applications available on the SIGFOX network,” said Mark Bannon, CEO of VT Networks. “Through these applications, businesses are creating a new range of solutions that will impact every sector in a cost-effective and reliable way.</p><p>“As part of VT Networks’ vision, we hope to advance Ireland as a hub for IoT innovation globally. This involves&nbsp;supporting Irish solution developers and manufacturers to introduce their products and services to the global SIGFOX market,” Bannon explained. “Being a SIGFOX Network Operator allows us to quickly benefit from a trusted network validated by leading companies in Europe and paired with the growing international ecosystem of partners created by SIGFOX.”</p><p>Building on its rapid growth in Europe and the U.S., SIGFOX is increasing the pace of its global expansion.
