<h1>SIGFOX continues to expand network coverage worldwide</h1>

<div class="illustration text-center"><img src="/img/news/map.png"></div><p>It is no secret that SIGFOX’s ambition is to democratise connectivity for the IoT and provide a truly global connectivity solution, available worldwide.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In the last couple of months we have welcomed Belgium and Denmark, who will both receive nationwide coverage of the SIGFOX dedicated IoT network. Stay tuned for yet another surprise announcement on the 28th July.</p><p><br></p><p><b>About BELGIUM deployment</b></p><b></b><p>SIGFOX, the global leader in cost-effective, energy-efficient Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity, and ENGIE announced that ENGIE M2M, a new ENGIE subsidiary, will deploy the SIGFOX IoT network across Belgium.&nbsp;</p><p>As a SIGFOX network operator, ENGIE M2M will work with Belgian developers and businesses to grow the IoT ecosystem and provide connectivity subscriptions to customers. By lowering barriers to more widespread implementation of IoT and machine- to-machine (M2M) connectivity, the SIGFOX global network will allow Belgian customers to connect millions of devices.</p><p>The network is expected to be available nationwide in two years. Electrabel, a Belgium- based electricity and natural-gas company and ENGIE subsidiary, also will explore opportunities to integrate the SIGFOX IoT network within its B2B and B2C solutions.</p><p>With this agreement, Belgium becomes the seventh European country where the SIGFOX dedicated IoT network is being rolled-out or already operating on a nationwide basis. This is also SIGFOX’s second announced partnership in the past month with a subsidiary of ENGIE. Cofely Services, Europe’s leader in energy and environmental-efficiency services for buildings, said it will use the SIGFOX network to expand services it provides building owners in France. ENGIE, formerly GDF Suez, also participated in SIGFOX’s recent venture capital round that raised $115 million from investors in the U.S., Europe and Asia.</p><p>“This collaboration with ENGIE is exciting and significant on two levels,” said Rodolphe Baronnet-Frugès, SIGFOX executive vice president of networks and operators. “First, it brings the many benefits of SIGFOX’s Internet of Things connectivity to businesses, governments and other users in Belgium and, second, it expands our relationship with the ENGIE Group, a global leader in solving the most pressing energy and environmental challenges.”</p><p>ENGIE M2M will work with Belgian developers and businesses to grow the IoT ecosystem in that country and then sell connectivity subscriptions to Belgian customers.</p><p><br></p><p><b>About DENMARK deployment</b></p><b></b><p>SIGFOX, the global leader in cost-effective, energy-efficient Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity, and IoT Denmark A/S announced in June their plans to roll out the SIGFOX network in the Scandinavian country.</p><p>As a SIGFOX Network Operator, IoT Denmark will manage deployment of the network, work with Danish developers and businesses to grow the Danish IoT ecosystem and provide connectivity subscriptions to customers. Network deployment, which will cover some areas of the country by this summer, is expected to be completed by May 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>Daniel Bachman, IoT Denmark’s CEO and founding partner, said the partnership with SIGFOX is designed to spur Danish entrepreneurs, engineers and others to create new IoT applications and projects that are easily justified by SIGFOX’s extremely cost-effective connectivity.</p><p>“Demand for SIGFOX’s low-cost, energy-efficient connectivity and its unmatched data capacity and reliability is very strong in Denmark, and we are in discussions with several future partners who are eager to begin using the network,” Bachman said. “We compared a variety of IoT network solutions, and determined that SIGFOX is the only one that is truly open to device manufacturers, and that can reliably handle the very large number of devices that will be connected across Denmark.”</p><p>SIGFOX, which recently raised $115 million in financing from U.S., European and Asian investors, is collaborating with partners in Spain, Portugal, France and the Netherlands, as well as many international cities, including San Francisco, Mumbai, Santiago, Chile; Medellin, Columbia; Munich, Milan, Warsaw, Poland; Dublin and 10 U.K. cities.</p><p>“IoT Denmark understands the demand in both the public and private sectors for SIGFOX’s superior connectivity and is committed to rapidly rolling out the network across the country,” said Rodolphe Baronnet-Frugès, SIGFOX executive vice president of networks and business development. “This once again highlights our network’s multiple advantages for partners and users compared to proposed alternatives. We expect to announce similar agreements in other Scandinavian countries, along with news of our expansion in the U.S., this summer.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>About IoT Denmark A/S</b></p><b></b><p>IoT Denmark was launched in 2015 to develop the Internet of Things in Denmark, as the exclusive provider of SIGFOX connectivity. As a SIGFOX Network Operator, the company will manage installation, operation and maintenance of the network in addition to offering subscriptions for customers to connect devices. The company also will work with Danish entrepreneurs, engineers and others to create IoT applications and projects that are easily justified by SIGFOX’s extremely cost-effective connectivity.</p><p>IoT Denmark is headquartered in Copenhagen and also has an office in Aarhus.

Moreover, the company partners with Texas Instruments, Atmel, Silicon Labs, Telit, AXSEM, ATIM and other chipmakers to give IoT users a wide choice of transceivers, systems-on-chips (SoCs) and modules for connecting their devices with its network. No other system offers this truly open approach.&nbsp;</p>
