title: The number of crowd-funded initiatives integrating SIGFOX continues to grow

<div class="illustration text-center"><img src="/img/news/hidnesek-01.jpg"></div><span><p>Crowd-funded initiatives are now an established worldwide phenomena and the number of new products integrating SIGFOX continues to grow. One of the most popular categories that we have seen is for tracking devices, such as HidnSeek by Stéphane Driussi &amp; Xavier Torres-Tuset. HidnSeek is described as a tiny and smart GPS Tracker which connects using the SIGFOX network and therefore has no GSM fee.</p><p>HidnSeek determines its location accurately with GPS technology and broadcasts the data using SIGFOX network connectivity. With SIGFOX committed to rolling out the network across the globe, this means that you will soon be able to locate almost anything you want, everywhere in the world!</p><p>Other tracking devices on the market often use Bluetooth or Cellular Tower technology to locate their devices, both of which have inherent limitations. Bluetooth has a limited detection span of around 40 meters maximum, while Cellular Tower technology has limited geo-localization accuracy, which may be greater than 500 meters. Both drain the battery fast.</p><p>On the other hand, HidnSeek has an amazing range, battery life and accuracy which will give you peace of mind that your things can never really be lost, while introducing a range of additional features that make it much more than just a GPS tracker.</p><p><b>“Body Guard” function</b></p><p>Using the built-in accelerometer you can activate a stationary alert mode. This means that friends or family can receive a notification on their smartphone if your HidnSeek device remains static beyond a chosen stationary alert period. This can be a great help for checking on an elderly relative or to ensure your loved ones are safe during their sporting expeditions. By sharing the tracker ID with “Body Guard” mode activated, anyone you trust will be alerted directly and notified of the exact location should there be no movement observed for a period of time from 1 to 15 minutes.</p><p><b>Geofencing</b></p><p>HidnSeek also goes beyond telling you where things are. With built-in geo-fencing technology, you can predefine a set of boundaries such as your school, neighbourhood, construction site or even around your mooring at the marina. If your HidnSeek device enters or exits a geo-fence, you will receive a notification directly to your smartphone. For the Drone Pilots among you, this function can also be useful to alert you if your drone flies out of reach and the GPS tracking will help you to retrieve your drone if it goes down unexpectedly. Enterprises can also introduce this function to keep track of where their equipment is, helping to improve asset management and productivity for many different scenarios.</p><p><b>DIY alert system</b></p><p>HidnSeek also offers a "motion sensor” mode using its accelerometer. This function can be used as an ad-hoc security system for your home, summer house, caravan or even your car. With a HidnSeek attached to a door, for example, you will be notified immediately wherever you are in the world if a movement is detected. </p><p>You no longer need to rely on an expensive security alarm system to secure your cherished possessions. HidnSeek's autonomous power supply and connectivity combined with the motion sensor functionality make it the ultimate convenient solution for your security needs.</p><p>HidnSeek is bundled with a smartphone application available for iOS, Android and Windows Phone. The number of HidnSeek devices that can be tracked and logged in the application is limitless, enabling you to manage multiple units, check the battery life status for all your HidnSeek devices and receive notifications when your devices need to be recharged.</p><p>HidnSeek uses the SIGFOX network to connect to a growing, global network which offers high capacity with very low energy consumption compared to GSM network connections, which are known to be very power intensive and which greatly limit tracking capability. It determines its position using GPS (Global Positioning System) and will transmit up to 140 geo-localisation updates per 24 hour period to the HidnSeek servers via the SIGFOX network.</p><p>Having the ability to control the frequency of updates enables users to decide what is best for their needs while being able to control and preserve battery life. Another great feature is that SIGFOX permits two-way communications with HidnSeek, which enables you to change your geo-localisation settings up to four times per day. For example you might want to set the "Body Guard” mode during your sporting event and switch it off once it is over.</p><p>Discover more on&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/837229404/hidnseekthe-revolutionary-gps-tracking-device">kickstarter</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>And for those of you who want to know more about yet another great product in the making, head over to their <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://beepings.uk/">website</a>, or visit their page on the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/beepings-zen-a-gps-tracker-lasting-up-to-1-year#/story">Indiegogo</a>&nbsp;funding platform directly.</p><div><br></div></span>
