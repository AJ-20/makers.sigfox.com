<h1>SIGFOX Extends Global Internet of Things Network Coverage To Mauritius and French Overseas Territories </h1>

<div class="illustration text-center"><img src="/img/news/butterfly.png"></div>LABEGE, France – Feb. 11, 2016 – SIGFOX, which aims to
establish its dedicated Internet of Things network on every continent in 2016 and
triple the number of countries covered, today announced coverage partnerships
with wireless network operators in Mauritius and the French Overseas
Territories.&nbsp;<br>

<p>The new SIGFOX Network Operators are:</p>

<ul><li>Viti in
French Polynesia</li><li>IDEO Caraïbes in Guadeloupe, Martinique and French Guiana,
and</li><li>IO
Connect in Mayotte, Reunion Island and the island nation of Mauritius, which is
part of the African continent</li></ul>





<p>With cities of high urban density, remote rural areas,
dense forests and extensive maritime business and recreational activities, the territories present opportunities for a broad range of cost-effective and
energy-efficient IoT services. These including remote meter reading and remote
energy-use payment, assistance monitoring for dependent persons, connected car
parks, location of ships and people at sea, coastal surveillance and
sustainable agricultural irrigation.</p>

<p>“SIGFOX’s dedicated IoT network enables innovative,
cost-effective solutions for multiple services, many of which are yet to be
developed,” said Rodolphe Baronnet-Frugès, SIGFOX Executive Vice-President Networks &amp; Operators. “By
providing those islands access to SIGFOX communications service, the new SNOs will
connect their customers to a rapidly growing global network and launch the
creation of a local IoT ecosystem that will help develop innovative, new
services.”<br></p>
