<h1>SIGFOX Will Announce Two Major Agreements and Present on Future of IoT</h1>

<div class="illustration text-center"><img src="/img/news/European-Utility-Week.jpg"></div><p><b>LABEGE, France – Oct. 27, 2015 – SIGFOX
will present at three sessions during European Utility Week in Vienna, Nov. 3-5.
The company will announce a partnership with a major French nationwide water
company that is using the Internet of Things to improve service and efficiency,
and an agreement with a global maker of low-cost smart electricity meters to
manufacture meters tailored to the SIGFOX network. The SIGFOX team and their
partners will be available for interviews at booth B. e17.</b></p>

<p>The vast
majority of smart utilities that will be connected to the IoT will require very
simple, economical and low-energy connectivity to transmit or receive their
data. In addition to meeting those requirements, SIGFOX supports a guaranteed
service-level agreement for customers, and simple subscription-based pricing.
Those advantages, all packaged with one contract, will allow makers of chips, systems
on chips, modules and end products, as well as platform and app developers to
seamlessly scale their solutions wherever the SIGFOX network is operating.</p>

<p><b>SIGFOX Booth: B. e17:</b> The company’s booth will demonstrate innovative utility solutions for gas,
electricity and water providers.</p>
