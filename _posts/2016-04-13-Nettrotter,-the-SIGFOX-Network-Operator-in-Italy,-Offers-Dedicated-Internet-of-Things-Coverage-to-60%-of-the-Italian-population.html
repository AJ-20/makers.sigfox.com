millions of sensors waiting to be connected, SIGFOX paves the way for multiple new IoT 

applications in all business and industry sectors. Its international ecosystem of partners helps 

developers and users wherever the network operates to create and deploy a wide range of 

IoT solutions.</p>

<p>SIGFOX’s IoT network is today operating in <a href="url">17 countries</a> and already registers more than 7

subscription-based low-power wide area (LPWA) connectivity solution, with access to
